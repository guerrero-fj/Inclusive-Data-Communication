# Tech_platforms 
The [[Tech_platforms]] considered in this study are Microsoft [[Teams]], [[Obsidian]] and [[MURAL]]. We use these [[Tech_platforms]] for our meetings, discussions (i.e., [[Org_Platforms]]) and partially for project management. Besides these [[Tech_platforms]], we also use [[RStudio]] and [[GitHub]] for [[PRODUCTS]] development and reproducibility. 

A key [[Tech_platforms]] for this project is [[ESS-DIVE]], where [[Data packages]] are shared. 

We also use [[PowerPoint]] for the creation of [[visual]] [[Assets]].
