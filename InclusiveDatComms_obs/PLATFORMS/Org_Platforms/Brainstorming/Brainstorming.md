# Brainstorming

 In this [[Brainstorming]] we will discuss ideas for the first [[Prototypes]] leading to the development of our [[PRODUCTS]], for both the [[Prototypes]] and [[Release_version]].

We will also decide where to store information about the [[PRODUCTS]] in either internally or through a repository in [[GitHub]].

For our [[Brainstorming]] session we will use [[Teams]] and [[MURAL]], while I will be taking notes in [[Obsidian]].

I will gather some ideas from the [[Lit_review]]. 

People attending this [[Brainstorming]] session include: [[Francisco J. Guerrero]], [[Amy Goldman]], [[Brieanne Forbes]], [[Sammi Grieger]], and [[Matt Kauffman]].
