* [[Decolonizing]]: “placing the knowledge expressed through storywork as the preferred authority over commentaries presented by external parties: “we mostly hear that version from a dominant perspective that has assumed the right to tell the stories of the colonized and the oppressed that they have re-interpreted, re-presented, and re-told through their own lens”
* It also links to the work on [[Storytelling]] as pedagogy by Jo-Ann Archibald
